# FLDAS2Cycles

Python script that converts processed FLDAS forcing files to Cycles weather files.

The Python script is a modified version of [@rynge](https://github.com/rynge)'s [python code](https://github.com/pegasus-isi/MINT-Workflow/blob/master/transformations/FLDAS-Cycles-transformation.py).
The algorithm that estimates daily maximum and minimum temperatures from daily average temperature and humidity is developed by [@kemanian](https://github.com/kemanian).
